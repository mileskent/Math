# Vector Projection
"The vector projection of B onto A"[^1]
$$
\vec{\text{proj}}_{\vec{A}} \vec{B} = \left(\vec{B} \cdot \hat{A}\right) \hat{A}
$$

# Scalar Projection
"The scalar projection of B onto A"
This is just the magnitude of the [[#Vector Projection]]. Hence "scalar"
$$
\text{proj}_{\vec{A}} \vec{B} = \vec{B} \cdot \hat{A}
$$

[^1]: For Georgia Tech undergraduate math, there is only the concept of a projection, where a project is a vector project, and is notated like a scalar projection.
