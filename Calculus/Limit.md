A limit is the value that a function approaches as the argument approaches some value
# Existence
$\lim_{ \vec{v} \to \vec{v}_{0} } f(\vec{v}) = L$ exists $\iff$ $f(\vec{v})$ approaches $L$ from every direction.
## Two Path Test
If you approach the limit from two different directions, and they disagree with one another, then this disproves the existence of the limit by definition, i.e. "limit DNE".
# Continous
$f(\vec{v})$ is continous at $\vec{v}_{0}$ $\iff \lim_{ \vec{v} \to \vec{v}_{0} } f(\vec{v}) = L\text{ exists}\ \land\ f(\vec{v}_{0})\text{ exists}\ \land\ L=f(\vec{v}_{0})$
