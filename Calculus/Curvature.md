The <u>curvature</u> of a [[Space Curve]] 
$$
\kappa(s) = \lVert \vec{T}'(s) \rVert
\quad\quad
\kappa(t) = \frac{\lVert\vec{T}'(t)\rVert}{\lVert\vec{r}'(t)\rVert}
=\frac{\lVert\vec{r'}(t)\times\vec{r}''(t)\rVert}{\lVert \vec{r}'(t)\rVert^3}
$$
where $\vec{T}(s)$ is the [[Space Curve#Unit Tangent Vector]] and $s$ is [[Arc Length]]

# Osculating Circle
The circle whose curvature is the same as a [[Space Curve]] at a particular point, and whose radius $R$ is reciprocal to the curvature at that point.

That is to say:
$$
\kappa = \frac{1}{R}
$$
