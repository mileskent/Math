# Stable
An [[Equilibrium Solution|equilibrium point]] is said to be **stable** if for some initial value close to the equilibrium point, the solution will eventually stay close to the equilibrium point

## Asymptotically Stable
An equilibrium point is said to be **asymptotically stable** if for some initial value close to the equilibrium point, the solution will not only eventually stay close, but also converge to the equilibrium point.

# Misc
For first order [[Differential Equation]]s, the motion of a point in a [[Phase Portrait]] won't cross a [[Equilibrium Point]]
