Given
$$
y' = f(y)
$$
An equilibrium point $y_{0}$ is where $f(y_{0}) = 0$. At such a point, the system's instantaneous rate of change is at a standstill.

# [[Stability]] of an Equilibrium Point
$f'(y_{0}) < 0 \implies$ [[Stability#Asymptotically Stable]]
$f'(y_{0}) > 0 \implies$ Unstable
$f'(y_{0}) = 0 \implies$ Inconclusive, must analyze deeper using definitions of [[Stability]]

> [!Note]
> $\dim f = 1 \iff$ $f$ is either asymptotically stable or unstable, but not only stable
