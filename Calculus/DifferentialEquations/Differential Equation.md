$$
# Types
[[Ordinary Differential Equation]]
[[Partial Differential Equation]]
[[Linear Differential Equation]]
[[Homogeneous Differential Equation]]
[[Separable Differential Equation]]
# Properties
## Order
The order of a differential equation is the maximum derivative degree of the function of interest, e.g. $y(t)$, in the equation. 

# Techniques
[[First Order Linear Differential Equation#Integrating Factor]]
[[Separable Differential Equation#Separation of Variables]]

# Special Examples
## Exponential Change
### Example 1
Population

$$
y' = ky \iff y(t)=y_0e^{kt}
$$

where $k$ is the net rate of change [per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita)

## Example 2
[Thermal Exchange](https://www.sciencefacts.net/newtons-law-of-cooling.html)

$$
T'(t) = -k(T(t) - T_\text{ambient})
\iff
T(t)=(T_0  -  T_\text{ambient})e^{-kt} +  T_\text{ambient}
$$
