$$
\frac{5x+3}{(x+1)(x+2)} = \frac{A}{x+1} + \frac{B}{x+2}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
5x+3 = A(x+2) + B(x+1) \\
5x+3 = (A+B)x + (2A+B) \\
A+B = 5, \quad 2A+B = 3 \\
\rightarrow A = -2, \quad B = 7 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\boxed{\frac{5x+3}{(x+1)(x+2)} = \frac{-2}{x+1} + \frac{7}{x+2}}
$$


For partial fractions, if you have a repeated factor such as $(x-a)^n$ in the denominator, you must have degrees 1 through $n$ in your partial fraction sum.
$$
\frac{\cdots}{\cdots (x-a)^n} = \cdots + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{c_i}{(x-a)^i}
$$
